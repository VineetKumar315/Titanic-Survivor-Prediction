# Titanic-Survivor-Prediction
In this model I have performed data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) then used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machine to compare the accuracy of each model. After that we selected DTC for our final model and tested the test dataset on it. I also analyzed the performance using a confusion matrix.
